## Overview
This project uses different models to predict the precipitation across five cities in Florida (Gainesville, Miami, Orlando, Panama City, Tampa). 
We use different features for this predicition, including mean temperature, max temperature, min temperature, and month.
The models we used are linear regression, general additive model (GAM), decision tree, random forest, and ARIMA.

## Structure
We have a basic structure set up for our project. In the main directory we have our report and a folder where our data and source code is located.
Inside this folder lies another folder called "data", which contains all our data we used for this project, and our Jupyter notebook file where all of our code is.

## Required Libraries
You will need the following libraries to run the code: matplotlib, numpy, pandas, pygam, scipy, seaborn, sklearn, statsmodels, and time. It is easiest to have pip already installed and simply run `pip install <library>` for each of the required dependencies in the terminal.

## How to Run
To run the code and produce the graphs, simply download the folder conatining our data and Jupyter notebook file, then open the notebook file in any program that supports it, such as PyCharm (Professional edition) or Visual Studio Code.
From there, you will be able to run specific code blocks to see each of our models in action!
